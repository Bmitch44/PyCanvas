## PyCanvas (In-Progress)
This project aims to provide a versatile solution for creating dynamic visual representations through an intuitive Python-based API. At the core, it's an open-source project for generating diagrams with nodes and edges. Nodes can represent various objects including groups, files, and text.

## Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:

- Versatility: To provide a tool that can create a wide variety of diagrams.
- Ease of use: The project is built with simplicity in mind. You can create complex diagrams using straightforward Python commands.
- Customizability: Nodes and edges can be customized in various ways to suit different needs. Node types include 'group', 'file', and 'text'.
- Extensibility: The project is designed to be easily extendable for future features and improvements.

## Current Progress
The project is in the development phase. So far, the base architecture for nodes, edges, and the canvas have been implemented. Node types currently include 'group', 'file', and 'text', each with its specific attributes and methods.
